                <h1>A co-founder at one of the world's largest communities.</h1>
                <p>The combined experience I have working at the top Fortune 500 companies has allowed me to developer a skillset that helps me in not just development, but in every aspect of any business.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm proud to announce that I am now working at one of the world's largest communities teaching young minds about how to sell yourself as a developer and open them to a whole new world of opportunities.</p>

                <p>As a developer, you have everything available to you and all that's holding you back is yourself.</p>
                <br>
                <p>A quote I live by perfectly illustrates what I mean.</p>
                <br>
                <p>"How big would you dream, if you knew you wouldn't fail?" You've already gone through the hardest parts being a developer, it's time to elevate your skills and become a leader in something you're passionate about.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I'm happy to chat over coffee some time about how I can help your company.</p>
